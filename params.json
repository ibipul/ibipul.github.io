{"name":"Bipul Islam","tagline":"ibipul.github.io","body":"### Welcome, you good Samaritan\r\n\r\nI am Bipul Islam. By way formal education I have recently completed M.Tech in Computer Science from Indian Statistical Institute (Kolkata). I am interested to pursue Ph.D's after this, for now I am taking some time off from formal studies to let my brain breathe. Right now I am involved in self initiated projects with my professors and also with a small work group that comprises of my younger brother and my father ( & of course a few of his grad students). I am always very interested in working on projects that involves a lot of data, end products are some awesome simulations, and that has some practical implications.\r\n\r\nSo I have worked on various kinds of projects till now apart from computer science related ones, which have involved mathematical ecology, fluid dynamics, chaos control, control systems etc. This was mainly because **who ever gives up the handy opportunity of doing science**? \r\n\r\nI would use this Github User page to archive my various old projects and also track my new ones.\r\n\r\n * [Latex2Html](http://ibipul.github.io/latex2html)\r\n * [Statistical Visualization Tools](http://ibipul.github.io/statistical_viz)\r\n * [OpenGL 3D Cubes](http://ibipul.github.io/openGLproj)\r\n * [Solving K Coloring Problem with SAT](http://ibipul.github.io/coloring_SAT)\r\n * [Unix Socket Inter Process communication] (http://ibipul.github.io/UnixSockets)\r\n * More to come!\r\n\r\n##### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe team members on these projects will be duly mentioned in each and every case. Things couldn't have shaped out the way things are now without their help! ","google":"UA-47995334-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
